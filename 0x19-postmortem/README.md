Postmortem: Web Stack Outage Incident
Issue Summary:
Duration:
Start Time: 2024-01-21 15:45 UTC
End Time: 2024-01-21 18:30 UTC

Impact:

The API service experienced a complete outage.
Users encountered service unavailability during the incident, affecting 30% of the user base.
Root Cause:
A critical database server failure due to a sudden spike in traffic, overwhelming the connection pool.

Timeline:
15:45 UTC: Issue detected through monitoring alerts indicating a sudden drop in API response times.
16:00 UTC: Initial investigation began, assuming a potential server misconfiguration.
16:30 UTC: Misleading path: Focused on the load balancer configuration, assuming it was struggling to distribute traffic evenly.
17:00 UTC: Escalated incident to the database team as signs pointed towards database-related issues.
17:30 UTC: Identified the actual root cause â€“ the database server reaching its connection limit.
18:00 UTC: Implemented a temporary fix by increasing the database connection pool.
18:30 UTC: Confirmed resolution after observing normal API response times.
Root Cause and Resolution:
Root Cause:
The sudden spike in traffic overwhelmed the database connection pool, leading to a critical failure.

Resolution:
Increased the database connection pool capacity to handle higher traffic loads. Additionally, implemented auto-scaling measures for future spikes.

Corrective and Preventative Measures:
Improvements/Fixes:

Optimize Database Queries: Conduct a thorough review of database queries to enhance efficiency.
Implement Traffic Throttling: Introduce traffic throttling mechanisms to control sudden surges.
Load Testing: Perform regular load testing to identify system limitations and adjust configurations accordingly.
Tasks to Address the Issue:

Database Monitoring: Enhance monitoring for early detection of database-related issues.
Automated Scaling: Implement automated scaling for critical services to handle increased traffic.
Documentation: Update incident response documentation for quicker resolution in future incidents.
This postmortem outlines the details of a web stack outage incident, emphasizing the duration, impact, root cause, and resolution. The timeline highlights the steps taken during the investigation, including a misleading path that was initially explored. The corrective and preventative measures suggest specific actions to improve the system's robustness and prevent similar incidents in the future.
